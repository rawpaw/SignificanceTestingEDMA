This Windows desktop application is used to create a dissimilarity matrix and growth matrix given a specific input file (.txt). The application is written by Daniel Roach and co-designed by Lauren Schroeder. The application .exe file can be found in the main folder and can be run on any Windows machine. 

EXAMPLE INPUT:

SPECIES_NAME_1, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
SPECIES_NAME_2, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
SPECIES_NAME_3, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
SPECIES_NAME_N, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
....
....etc

The outputs are textfiles containing matrices with comma separated values (similar to the input file).

NOTE:

This application is designed for a specific input and output and is not completely robust. There are known issues and these can be addressed in the future. Any queries related to the code can be directed to Daniel Roach. Any queries related to the analysis algortithm and design can be directed to Lauren Schroeder. Both can be contacted at lschroeder1510@gmail.com.
