This Windows desktop application is used to create a dissimilarity matrix and growth matrix given a specific input file (.txt). The application is written by Daniel Roach and co-designed by Lauren Schroeder. The application .exe file can be found in the main folder and can be run on any Windows machine. 

EXAMPLE INPUT:

SPECIES_NAME_1, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
SPECIES_NAME_2, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
SPECIES_NAME_3, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
SPECIES_NAME_N, <distance1>, <distance2>, ....., <distanceN>
....
....etc

The outputs are textfiles containing matrices with comma separated values (similar to the input file).
